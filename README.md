# Zachary Kerbo — Backend-Focused Engineer (Go/Python)

Backend developer in progress with **9+ years** across **Senior Production Support (7 yrs)** and **Quality Assurance (2 yrs)**. I’ve led incident response and root‑cause analysis for large, patient‑facing systems, and now I’m building reliable, testable **Go** services backed by **PostgreSQL** and clean API design.

## 🧰 Core Skills
- **Languages:** Go, Python, SQL  
- **Backend:** REST APIs, PostgreSQL, SQLC, Goose migrations, authentication (sessions + CSRF), caching, integration with third‑party APIs  
- **Quality & Ops:** Manual/Exploratory testing, Postman, Selenium, log analysis, debugging, RCA, CI/CD, AWS (S3, CloudWatch)  

## 📌 Pinned Projects
- **[PokemonGolang](https://github.com/JadedPigeon/PokemonGolang)** — Go REST API game server that integrates the PokéAPI, persists data in Postgres, auto‑selects damaging moves, and supports **AI‑generated battle narration** via OpenAI; includes session auth + CSRF, SQLC, and Goose migrations. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
- **[Zudoku](https://github.com/JadedPigeon/Zudoku)** — A Tkinter‑based Sudoku app in Python with assists (validation, hints, undo, timer, highscores) and a simple launcher. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🎯 What I’m Doing Now
- Building production‑ready Go services (data modeling, migrations, auth, API contracts) and documenting them clearly for others to run and test.

## 🤝 Open To
**Backend Developer, Software Engineer, or Quality Engineering** roles where reliability, observability, and clear API design matter.
