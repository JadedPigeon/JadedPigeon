# Zachary Kerbo â€” Backend Engineer (Go/Python) | QA & Production Support

## ðŸ‘‹ About Me
Iâ€™m Zachary Kerbo, a software professional with 9+ years of experience spanning Quality Assurance (2), Senior Production Support (7), and now backend development. My background in debugging, SQL, APIs, and supporting large-scale production systems naturally led me to pursue backend engineering, where Iâ€™ve built projects in Go and Pythonâ€”including a REST API capstone that integrates authentication, database design, and third-party APIs. I thrive on problem solving, continuous learning, and turning complex systems into reliable solutions. Iâ€™m eager to take on tough engineering challenges and deliver software that makes a real-world impact.

## ðŸ§° Core Skills
- **Languages:** Go, Python, SQL  
- **Backend:** REST API design, PostgreSQL, SQLC, Goose migrations, authentication (sessions + CSRF), caching, integration with external APIs  
- **Quality & Ops:** Manual/Exploratory testing, Postman, Selenium, log analysis, debugging, RCA, CI/CD, AWS (S3, CloudWatch)
